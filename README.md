This release contains a labelled dataset of 2206 images of waste materials, divided into three primary categories: **Non-Recyclable Waste**, **Recyclable Waste**, and **Hazardous Waste**.

📁 Dataset Composition:
- Non-Recyclable Waste: 720 images
- Recyclable Waste: 742 images
- Hazardous Waste: 744 images

🧾 Key Features:
- Collected from real-world sources including household trash, public waste spots, and open-source image repositories.
- Captured using Redmi Note 12 Pro (50mp) and iPhone 13 (12mp).
- Images vary in lighting, background, and object orientation for better generalisation in training models.
- All images are manually labelled and stored in `.jpg` or `.png` format.
- Preprocessed to a uniform resolution of **640x480 pixels** for deep learning compatibility.

🎯 Purpose:
This dataset supports the development of deep learning models for automatic waste segregation systems in smart cities and environmental applications.
